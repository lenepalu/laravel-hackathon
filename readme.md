## Laravel-Hackathon

Laravel Hackathon is a "starter kit" you can use to build your first API in seconds. As you can easily imagine, it is built on top of the awesome Laravel Framework. This version is built on Laravel 5.4!

It is built on top of three big guys:

* JWT-Auth - [tymondesigns/jwt-auth](https://github.com/tymondesigns/jwt-auth)
* Dingo API - [dingo/api](https://github.com/dingo/api)
* Laravel-CORS [barryvdh/laravel-cors](http://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-cors)


## Installation

1. run `composer create-project poush/laravel-hackathon myNextProject`;
2. have a coffee, nothing to do here;

Once the project creation procedure will be completed, run the `php artisan migrate` command to install the required tables.
